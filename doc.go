// Package poems is a extension for the goldmark
// (http://github.com/yuin/goldmark).
//
// This extension adds parsing code blocks in markdown document as poems.
//  Alas for man! day after day may rise,
// 	  Night may shade his thankless head,
//  He sees no God in the bright, morning skies
// 	  He sings no praises from his guarded bed.
